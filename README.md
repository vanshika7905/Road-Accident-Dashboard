Road Accident Analysis using Excel
🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard🛣️

An interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw accident data into meaningful insights. This project analyzes how vehicle type, road conditions, weather patterns, light conditions, and regional factors contribute to road casualties. It includes dynamic slicers, KPIs, and trend visuals to help understand accident behavior across different dimensions.

📊 Project Overview

• The Road Accident Dashboard provides a comprehensive breakdown of accident trends, allowing users to explore:

• Accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

• Monthly trends (CY vs PY comparison)

• Vehicle-wise casualties

• Rural vs. urban accident distribution

• Daylight vs. darkness patterns

• Road type and road surface impact

• Weather and wind conditions

• Year-wise filtering for deeper analysis

• This dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making, improve road safety awareness, and highlight key risk factors.

📌 Key Insights Identified

• Accident counts vary significantly with weather and road conditions

• Majority of casualties occur under slight severity

• Cars and bikes contribute the highest number of casualties

• Wet road surfaces and high winds correlate with increased risk

• Urban regions show higher incidents compared to rural areas

• Night-time (darkness) accidents remain a major concern
